Chain Reaction
The objective of this project was for me to try out some basic animation.<br />
I achieved the animation by changing the objects position at each time frame and ajusting them to easyin, easyout,hard drop, etc, depending on how the object moved.<br />
Part of the inspiration for this project came from the following inmage, then the rest I added to make it a continuous loop:<br />

Since I was just starting animation I was not able get the a good water animation, but I improvised by have donut shaped models move up adn down
