Chain Reaction
The objective of this project was for me to try out some basic animation.
I achieved the animation by changing the objects position at each time frame and ajusting them to easyin, easyout,hard drop, etc, depending on how the object moved.
The inspiration of this project can be seen in ChainReaction/sourceimages.
