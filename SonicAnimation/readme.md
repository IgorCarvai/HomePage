# SonicAnimation
This goal of this project was to build a character and animate it using rigging and IK handles.<br />
At this point I was comfortable modeling a character and I had an idea that for the animation I wanted the character to jump, do a flip and land. For this reason I chose to model Sonic.<br />

I did have some trouble with the IK handles and gettin gthe naimtion to wrok but overall I liked the way it looked in the end.<br />

Some future work that I would do is work more on the rigging of it, change the spin so it is more like a ball, and add more effects such as adding more animation to his hair.
